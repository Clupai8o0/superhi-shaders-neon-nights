From New York to Nairobi, São Paulo to Seoul, these evocative photographs capture the neon-lit landscapes of some of the world’s most iconic cities. Korean photographer Kim Sung-min took portraits of strangers he met during chance encounters on the street. His visual record serves as a reminder of the intimate connection between humans and the urban landscapes they live in.

Kim Sung-min was born in Seoul and began taking photographs at age 12. Specializing in street photography, he travels around the world to work on personal projects like Neon Nights as well as for editorial clients.
